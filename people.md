#### Iddo Friedberg

I am an Associate Professor at the department of Veterinary Microbiology & Preventive Medicine at Iowa State University. I am interested in large scale analyses of protein sequence, structure and function connections, genome evolution, metagenome analysis and computational protein function prediction. I am leading CAFA, the Critical Assessment of Function Annotations, a global community effort to improve our ability to predict protein function from sequence.

In my spare time (ha!) I enjoy long distance running, old 70's cop shows, spaghetti westerns, and embarrassing my kids.

My research interests include bacterial protein function, microbiomes, and machine learning methods. I was born and raised in Texas, and my family is from Hong Kong. Outside of research, I like to cook and make plots in R.

I am a Ph.D. student in the computer science department. I find myself motivated to solve problems in biology and human health. My research interests include genomics, NLP and deep learning. My current research involves identifying genomic islands from whole genome sequences. I would like to expand my research into computational models for metagenomics data. I enjoy dancing (not sure if others enjoy watching me), painting and pointless conversations about life.

Ignore me. Do not ignore my genes. #ignoromenot
Proteome means no protein gets left behind.

I am a graduate student in the Bioinformatics and Computational Biology program working on Gene Ontology annotations to explore the imbalance in the functional study between well-known and lesser-known proteins. I am also interested in genomic sequencing and all sorts of things that could be done from those data.

I love reading, but only crime thrillers, love cooking, but prefer eating someone else's food!
