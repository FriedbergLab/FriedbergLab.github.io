#### General software

+ [**SwiftOrtho**](https://github.com/FriedbergLab/SwiftOrtho) SwiftOrtho is a fast orthology analysis tool that identifies orthologs, paralogs, and co-orthologs for genomes using a graph-based approach.
+ [**ROAGUE**](https://github.com/FriedbergLab/Ancestral-Blocks-Reconstruction)  (**R**econstruction **o**f **A**ncestral **G**ene Blocks **U**sing **E**vents) is a tool to reconstruct ancestors of gene blocks in prokaryotic genomes. Gene blocks are genes co-located on the chromosome. In many cases, gene blocks are conserved between bacterial species, sometimes as operons, when genes are co-transcribed. The conservation is rarely absolute: gene loss, gain, duplication, block splitting and block fusion are frequently observed.
+ [**POEM**](https://github.com/FriedbergLab/POEM) POEM is a pipeline that can predict operons and core operons from metagenomic genome/assembly or short reads. It can be run on most * NIX systems.
+ [**TreasureIsland**](https://github.com/FriedbergLab/GenomicIslandPrediction) TreasureIsland is a machine learning-based Genomic Island prediction software that uses an unsupervised representation of DNA for its prediction.
+ [**EpicTope**](https://github.com/FriedbergLab/Epictope) Epitope tagging is a technique enabling the identification, tracking, and purification of proteins _in vivo_. EpicTope helps experimentalists identify proter epitope insertion sites using CRISPR-cas9  

#### CAFA Related software
+ [**GOThresher**](https://github.com/FriedbergLab/GOThresher) Use this to remove annotation biases from Uniprot-GOA files. Usefule fro preparing rtaining sets for protein function prediction software.
+ [**CAFA_Benchmark**](https://github.com/CAFA-Challenge/CAFA_benchmark) Create benchmarks fro CAFA assessments using Uniprot-GOA files from different dates.
+ [**CAFA-swissprot**](https://github.com/CAFA-Challenge/cafa-swissprot) create an initial dataset for CAFA competitors from a Swissprot-Uniprot file.
+ [**CAFA_evaluation**](https://github.com/CAFA-Challenge/CAFA_evaluation) a suite of tools to evaluate CAFA predictions.

#### Fun stuff
+ [**paperchaser**](https://github.com/idoerg/paperchaser) A script that accepts a file of author names and prints out the collective papers of these authors. No duplicaitons, i.e. of two or more authors collaborated on a paper, that paper will appear only once. The script uses Biopython's Entrez utilities to get the papers from the PubMed database. Other manuscript repositories are not supported currently.
+ [**authorator**](https://github.com/idoerg/authorator) A Python program to create a LaTeX file with a large number of authors and affiliations.
